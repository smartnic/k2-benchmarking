CURRENT ISSUES:
1) Utilized version of the Linux kernel does not include some xdp programs referenced in the K2 paper.
2) Many compiled BPF samples fail to run due to segmentation faults and other BPF related errors.
3) 2/4 BPF object files fail to be run through the text extractor for BPF related errors.
4) The .desc files necessary to run the object files (.insns/.maps) are not generated.
